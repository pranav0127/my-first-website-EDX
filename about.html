		<li id="py"> Pythagoras of Samos <a href="#cont">Back to Top</a></li>
			<p>Greek Mathematician Pythagoras is considered by some to be one of the first great mathematicians. Living around 570 to 495 BC, in modern day Greece, he is known to have founded the Pythagorean cult, who were noted by Aristotle to be one of the first groups to actively study and advance mathematics. He is also commonly credited with the Pythagorean Theorem within trigonometry.</p>

			<img src="https://listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/pythagoras.jpg">
			<div class="state4">The Pythagoras Theorem</div>
			<p>He is mainly remembered for what has become known as Pythagoras’ Theorem (or the Pythagorean Theorem): that, for any right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side, opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the square of the other two sides (or “legs”). Written as an equation: a2 + b2 = c2.</p>

			<div class="state4">Music Theory</div>
			<p>Pythagoras is also credited with the discovery that the intervals between harmonious musical notes always have whole number ratios. For instance, playing half a length of a guitar string gives the same note as the open string, but an octave higher; a third of a length gives a different but harmonious note; etc.</p>



		<li id="pl"> Plato <a href="#cont">Back to Top</a></li>
			<p>Plato played an important role in encouraging and inspiring Greek intellectuals to study mathematics as well as philosophy. His Academy taught mathematics as a branch of philosophy, as Pythagoras had done, and the first 10 years of the 15 year course at the Academy involved the study of science and mathematics, including plane and solid geometry, astronomy and harmonics. Plato became known as the “maker of mathematicians”, and his Academy boasted some of the most prominent mathematicians of the ancient world, including Eudoxus, Theaetetus and Archytas.</p>	

			<div class="state4">Platonic Solids</div>
			<p>Plato the mathematician is perhaps best known for his identification of 5 regular symmetrical 3-dimensional shapes, which he maintained were the basis for the whole universe, and which have become known as the Platonic Solids: </p>

			<img src="https://www.storyofmathematics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/platonic_solids.gif">
				<ol>
					<li>the tetrahedron (constructed of 4 regular triangles, and which for Plato represented fire)</li>
					<li>the octahedron (composed of 8 triangles, representing air)</li>
					<li>the icosahedron (composed of 20 triangles, and representing water)</li>
					<li>the cube (composed of 6 squares, and representing earth)</li>
					<li>the dodecahedron (made up of 12 pentagons)</li>
				</ol>

			<p>Plato obscurely described as <span style="font-weight: bolder;">“the god used for arranging the constellations on the whole heaven”</span></p>	



		<li id="eu"> Euclid <a href="#cont">Back to Top</a></li>	
			<p>The Greek mathematician Euclid lived and flourished in Alexandria in Egypt around 300 BCE, during the reign of Ptolemy I. Almost nothing is known of his life, and no likeness or first-hand description of his physical appearance has survived antiquity, and so depictions of him (with a long flowing beard and cloth cap) in works of art are necessarily the products of the artist’s imagination.</p>

			<p>Euclid is often referred to as the “Father of Geometry”, and he wrote perhaps the most important and successful mathematical textbook of all time, the “Stoicheion” or “Elements”, which represents the culmination of the mathematical revolution which had taken place in Greece up to that time. He also wrote works on the division of geometrical figures into into parts in given ratios, on catoptrics (the mathematical theory of mirrors and reflection), and on spherical astronomy (the determination of the location of objects on the “celestial sphere”), as well as important texts on optics and music.</p>
			<img src="https://www.storyofmathematics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/euclid_postulates.gif">


			<div class="state4">Euclid’s five general axioms were:</div>
			<ol>
				<li>Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other.</li>
				<li>If equals are added to equals, the wholes (sums) are equal.</li>
				<li>If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders (differences) are equal.</li>
				<li>Things that coincide with one another are equal to one another.</li>
				<li>The whole is greater than the part.</li>
			</ol>
			

		<li id="ar">Archimedes <a href="#cont">Back to Top</a></li>
			<p>Another Greek mathematician who studied at Alexandria in the 3rd Century BCE was Archimedes, although he was born, died and lived most of his life in Syracuse, Sicily (a Hellenic Greek colony in Magna Graecia). Little is known for sure of his life, and many of the stories and anecdotes about him were written long after his death by the historians of ancient Rome.</p>

			<p>Also an engineer, inventor and astronomer, Archimedes was best known throughout most of history for his military innovations like his siege engines and mirrors to harness and focus the power of the sun, as well as levers, pulleys and pumps (including the famous screw pump known as Archimedes’ Screw, which is still used today in some parts of the world for irrigation).</p>

			<ol class="state2">
				<li>Method of Exhaustion</li><img src="https://www.storyofmathematics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/archimedes_circle.gif">
					<div>Archimedes produced formulas to calculate the areas of regular shapes, using a revolutionary method of capturing new shapes by using shapes he already understood. For example, to estimate the area of a circle, he constructed a larger polygon outside the circle and a smaller one inside it. He first enclosed the circle in a triangle, then in a square, pentagon, hexagon, etc, etc, each time approximating the area of the circle more closely. By this so-called “method of exhaustion” (or simply “Archimedes’ Method”)</div>

				<li>Quadrature of Parabola</li><img src="https://www.storyofmathematics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/archimedes_parabola.gif">
					<div>Archimedes’ most sophisticated use of the method of exhaustion, which remained unsurpassed until the development of integral calculus in the 17th Century, was his proof – known as the Quadrature of the Parabola – that the area of a parabolic segment is 4⁄3 that of a certain inscribed triangle. He dissected the area of a parabolic segment (the region enclosed by a parabola and a line) into infinitely many triangles whose areas form a geometric progression. He then computed the sum of the resulting geometric series, and proved that this is the area of the parabolic segment.</div>

				<li>The Archimedes Principle</li><img src="https://www.storyofmathematics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/archimedes_sphere.gif">
					<div>Despite his important contributions to pure mathematics, though, Archimedes is probably best remembered for the anecdotal story of his discovery of a method for determining the volume of an object with an irregular shape.</div>
					<div>While taking his bath on day, he noticed that that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in, and he had the sudden inspiration that he could use this effect to determine the volume (and therefore the density) of the crown. In his excitement, he apparently rushed out of the bath and ran naked through the streets shouting, “Eureka! Eureka!” (“I found it! I found it!”). This gave rise to what has become known as <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Archimedes’ Principle</span>: an object is immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.</div>

			</ol>

		<li id="di">Diophantus Of Alexandria <a href="#cont">Back to Top</a></li>
			<p>Diophantus was a Hellenistic Greek (or possibly Egyptian, Jewish or even Chaldean) mathematician who lived in Alexandria during the 3rd Century CE. He is sometimes called “the father of algebra”, and wrote an influential series of books called the “Arithmetica”, a collection of algebraic problems which greatly influenced the subsequent development of number theory.</p>

			<p>He also made important advances in mathematical notation, and was one of the first mathematicians to introduce symbolism into algebra, using an abridged notation for frequently occurring operations, and an abbreviation for the unknown and for the powers of the unknown. He was perhaps the first to recognize fractions as numbers in their own right, allowing positive rational numbers for the coefficients and solutions of his equations.</p>
			<img src="https://www.storyofmathematics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/diophantine_equations.gif">
			<p>Diophantus’ major work (and the most prominent work on algebra in all Greek mathematics) was his “Arithmetica”, a collection of problems giving numerical solutions of both determinate and indeterminate equations. Of the original thirteen books of the “Arithmetica”, only six have survived, although some Diophantine problems from “Arithmetica” have also been found in later Arabic sources. His problems exercised the minds of many of the world’s best mathematicians for much of the next two millennia, with some particularly celebrated solutions provided by Brahmagupta, Pierre de Fermat, Joseph Louis Lagrange and Leonhard Euler, among others.</p>

		<li id="ro">ROMAN MATHEMATICS – Numerals & Arithmetic <a href="#cont">Back to Top</a></li>
			<p>By the middle of the 1st Century BCE, the Roman had tightened their grip on the old Greek and Hellenistic empires, and the mathematical revolution of the Greeks ground to halt. Despite all their advances in other respects, no mathematical innovations occurred under the Roman Empire and Republic, and there were no mathematicians of note. The Romans had no use for pure mathematics, only for its practical applications, and the Christian regime that followed it </p>
			<img src="https://www.storyofmathematics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/roman_numerals.gif">

			<p>Roman numerals are well known today, and were the dominant number system for trade and administration in most of Europe for the best part of a millennium. It was decimal (base 10) system but not directly positional, and did not include a zero, so that, for arithmetic and mathematical purposes, it was a clumsy and inefficient system. It was based on letters of the Roman alphabet – I, V, X, L, C, D and M – combines to signify the sum of their values (e.g. VII = V + I + I = 7).</p>

		<li id="mayan">The Mayan Civilisation <a href="#cont">Back to Top</a></li>
			<p>The Mayan civilisation had settled in the region of Central America from about 2000 BCE, although the so-called Classic Period stretches from about 250 CE to 900 CE. At its peak, it was one of the most densely populated and culturally dynamic societies in the world.</p>

			<p>The importance of astronomy and calendar calculations in Mayan society required mathematics, and the Maya constructed quite early a very sophisticated number system, possibly more advanced than any other in the world at the time</p>	

			<img src="https://www.storyofmathematics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/mayan_numerals.gif">

			<ul class="state1">
				<li>Vigesimal – Base 20 Number System</li>
					<p>The Mayan and other Mesoamerican cultures used a vigesimal number system based on base 20, (and, to some extent, base 5), probably originally developed from counting on fingers and toes. The numerals consisted of only three symbols: zero, represented as a shell shape; one, a dot; and five, a bar. Thus, addition and subtraction was a relatively simple matter of adding up dots and bars. After the number 19, larger numbers were written in a kind of vertical place value format using powers of 20: 1, 20, 400, 8000, 160000, etc (see image above), although in their calendar calculations they gave the third position a value of 360 instead of 400 (higher positions revert to multiples of 20).</p>

				<li>Mayan Zero</li>	
					<p>The pre-classic Maya and their neighbours had independently developed the concept of zero (Mayan zero) by at least as early as 36 BCE, and we have evidence of their working with sums up to the hundreds of millions, and with dates so large it took several lines just to represent them. Despite not possessing the concept of a fraction, they produced extremely accurate astronomical observations using no instruments other than sticks and were able to measure the length of the solar year to a far higher degree of accuracy than that used in Europe </p>

			</ul>

		<div class="state3"><li id="madhava"> MADHAVA: The Founder of Kerela School <a href="#cont">Back to Top</a></li></div>	
			<p>Madhava sometimes called the greatest mathematician-astronomer of medieval India. He came from the town of Sangamagrama in Kerala, near the southern tip of India, and founded the Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics in the late 14th Century.</p>

			<p>Although almost all of Madhava’s original work is lost, he is referred to in the work of later Kerala mathematicians as the source for several infinite series expansions (including the sine, cosine, tangent and arctangent functions and the value of π), representing the first steps from the traditional finite processes of algebra to considerations of the infinite, with its implications for the future development of calculus and mathematical analysis.</p>
			<img src="https://www.storyofmathematics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/madhava_pi.gif">

			<ul class="state1">
				<li>Madhava Series</li>
					<p>Madhava went further and linked the idea of an infinite series with geometry and trigonometry. He realized that, by successively adding and subtracting different odd number fractions to infinity, he could home in on an exact formula for π (this was two centuries before Leibniz was to come to the same conclusion in Europe). Through his application of this series, Madhava obtained a value for π correct to an astonishing 13 decimal places.</p>

					<p>He went on to use the same mathematics to obtain infinite series expressions for the sine formula, which could then be used to calculate the sine of any angle to any degree of accuracy, as well as for other trigonometric functions like cosine, tangent and arctangent. Perhaps even more remarkable, though, is that he also gave estimates of the error term or correction term, implying that he quite understood the limit nature of the infinite series.</p>
