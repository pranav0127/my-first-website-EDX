	<div class="p1" style="background-image: url('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/P._Oxy._I_29.jpg ')">
		<p>MATHEMATICS has played a significant role in the development of Indian culture for millennia. Mathematical ideas that originated in the Indian subcontinent have had a profound impact on the world. Swami Vivekananda said: ‘you know how many sciences had their origin in India. Mathematics began there. You are even today counting 1, 2, 3, etc. to zero, after Sanskrit figures, and you all know that algebra also originated in India.</p>

		<p>It is also a fitting time to review the contributions of Indian mathematicians from ancient times to the present, as in 2010, India will be hosting the International Congress of Mathematicians. This quadrennial meeting brings together mathematicians from around the world to discuss the most significant developments in the subject over the past four years and to get a sense of where the subject is heading in the next four. The idea of holding such a congress at regular intervals actually started at The Columbian Exhibition in Chicago in 1893. This exhibition had sessions to highlight the advancement of knowledge in different fields. One of these was a session on mathematics. Another, perhaps more familiar to readers of Prabuddha Bharata, was the famous Parliament of Religions in which Swami Vivekananda first made his public appearance in the West.</p>



		<p>In ancient time, mathematics was mainly used in an auxiliary or applied role. Thus, mathematical methods were used to solve problems in architecture and construction (as in the public works of the Harappan civilization) in astronomy and astrology (as in the words of the Jain mathematicians) and in the construction of Vedic altars (as in the case of the Shulba Sutras of Baudhayana and his successors). By the sixth or fifth century BCE, mathematics was being studied for its own sake, as well as for its applications in other fields of knowledge.</p>

	<div class="p2" style="background-image: url('https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Panoramic_view_of_the_stupa_mound_and_great_bath_in_Mohenjodaro.jpg')">

		

		<p>The Indus valley civilization is considered to have existed around 3000 BCE. Two of its most famous cities, Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, provide evidence that construction of buildings followed a standardized measurement which was decimal in nature. Here, we see mathematical ideas developed for the purpose of construction. This civilization had an advanced brick-making technology (having invented the kiln). Bricks were used in the construction of buildings and embankments for flood control.</p>

		<p>The study of astronomy is considered to be even older, and there must have been mathematical theories on which it was based. Even in later times, we find that astronomy motivated considerable mathematical development, especially in the field of trigonometry.</p>

		<p>Much has been written about the mathematical constructions that are to be found in Vedic literature. In particular, the Shatapatha Brahmana, which is a part of the Shukla Yajur Veda, contains detailed descriptions of the geometric construction of altars for yajnas. Here, the brick-making technology of the Indus valley civilization was put to a new use. As usual there are different interpretations of the dates of Vedic texts, and in the case of this Brahmana, the range is from 1800 to about 800 BCE. Perhaps it is even older.</p>

		<p>Supplementary to the Vedas are the Shulba Sutras. These texts are considered to date from 800 to 200 BCE. Four in number, they are named after their authors: Baudhayana (600 BCE), Manava (750 BCE), Apastamba (600 BCE), and Katyayana (200 BCE ). The sutras contain the famous theorem commonly attributed to Pythagoras. </p>

		<p>The Shulba Sutras introduce the concept of irrational numbers, numbers that are not the ratio of two whole numbers. For example, the square root of 2 is one such number. The sutras give a way of approximating the square root of number using rational numbers through a recursive procedure which in modern language would be a ‘series expansion’.</p>
		<p>This predates, by far, the European use of Taylor series.</p>

		<p>It is interesting that the mathematics of this period seems to have been developed for solving practical geometric problems, especially the construction of religious altars. However, the study of the series expansion for certain functions already hints at the development of an algebraic perspective. In later times, we find a shift towards algebra, with simplification of algebraic formulate and summation of series acting as catalysts for mathematical discovery.</p>

	<div><h1 style="color: rgb(100,30,22);font-weight: bolder;font-size: 45px;">The Classical Era of Indian Mathematics<a href="#navbarNav" style="color: red;font-size: 15px;">Back to Top</a> </h1><h1>(500 to 1200 CE)</h1></div>

	<div class="p3">
		<p>The most famous names of Indian mathematics belong to what is known as the classical era. This includes <span class="name"> Aryabhata I (500 CE) Brahmagupta (700 CE), Bhaskara I (900 CE), Mahavira (900 CE), Aryabhatta II (1000 CE) and Bhaskarachrya or Bhaskara II (1200 CE)</span> .</p>

		<p>During this period, two centers of mathematical research emerged, one at Kusumapura near Pataliputra and the other at Ujjain. Aryabhata I was the dominant figure at Kusumapura and may even have been the founder of the local school. His fundamental work, the Aryabhatiya, set the agenda for research in mathematics and astronomy in India for many centuries</p>

		<div id="arya" style="color:rgb(100,30,32); font-weight: bolder;font-size: 40px">Aryabhatta Discovery (476-550 AD)<a href="#navbarNav" style="color: red;font-size: 15px;">Back to Top</a></div>
		
		<div class="p4">
			<p>One of Aryabhata’s discoveries was a method for solving linear equations of the form
			ax + by = c. Here a, b, and c are whole numbers, and we seeking values of x and y in whole numbers satisfying the above equation. For example if a = 5, b =2, and c =8 then x =8 and y = -16 is a solution. In fact, there are infinitely many solutions:</p>

			<p>x = 8 -2m</p>
			<p>y = 5m -16</p>

			<p>where m is any whole number, as can easily be verified. Aryabhata devised a general method for solving such equations, and he called it the kuttaka (or pulverizer) method. He called it the pulverizer because it proceeded by a series of steps, each of which required the solution of a similar problem, but with smaller numbers. Thus, a, b, and c were pulverized into smaller numbers.</p>
			<div style="color:red; font-weight: bolder;font-size: 30px">His Contribution to Astronomy</div>

			<p>He had a very sharp brain and his dedication and hard work led him to solve the various mysteries of the solar system. He also deduced that the earth is round in shape and rotates along its own axis, which forms the existence of day and night. Many superstitious beliefs were challenged by him and he presented scientific reasons to prove them wrong.</p>

			<p>He also said that the moon has no light and shines because it reflects light from the sun. He also proved wrong the false belief that eclipse is caused because of the shadows formed by the shadows cast by the earth and the moon. Aryabhatta used epicycles in a similar manner to the Greek Philosopher Ptolemy to illustrate the inconsistent movement of some planets. This great astronomer wrote the famous treatise Aryabhatiya, which was based on astronomy</p>

			<p>In 499 AD. This treatise was acknowledged as a masterpiece. In honour of this excellent work Aryabhatta was made head of the Nalanda University by the Gupta ruler Buddhagupta.</p>

			<div style="color:red; font-weight: bolder;font-size: 30px">His role in the Place Value System</div>

			<p>He also played a very major role in determining the place value system and discovering the zero. He also worked on the summation series of square roots and cube roots. He is also regarded as the first to use zero in the place value system. He also calculated the sidereal rotation, which is the rotation of the earth in relation to the fixed stars. His theories and deductions formed the base of the trigonometry and algebra.</p>

			<p>For his extraordinary works and contributions to mathematics and astronomy, India’s first satellite was named as Aryabhatta. Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences near Nainital and the Aryabhatta Knowledge University in Patna, in India are also named after him.</p>

			<div style="color:red; font-weight: bolder;font-size: 30px">Contribution in the approximation of Pi</div>

			<p>Aryabhatta is among the mathematicians who brought new deductions and theories in mathematics and astronomy. His contribution to the mathematics is unmatched and cannot be ignored, as he was the one who deduced the approximate value of pi, which he found it to be 3.14. He also derived the correct formulas for calculating the areas of triangles and circles. He also played a very important role in the formation of the table of Sines.</p>

		<div class="p5">
			<p>The Ancient Indian mathematician is so unique, thanks for his discovery of the properties of precisely zero. He was the first person in the world's history who defined the properties of the number zero. Considering it as a number with properties which needs to be defined has opened so much important chances for both mathematics and science until now. Brahmagupta defined zero as the number that you actually get when doing a subtract from a number to itself. He indicated that a zero divides any number always results in zero. (Unfortunately, he said 'any number' includes number zero).</p>


			<p>Brahmagupta actually got wrong when he said that zero divided zero is zero, though this seems reasonable. Now, mathematicians have shown that there's really no answer to the result of the equation "zero divides zero". This is absolutely undefined and has no meaning.</p>

			<p>Brahmagupta was also the first mathematician who discovered the formula for working with quadratic equations. This actually simplifies to Heron's formula for triangles.</p>
			<p style="color:red; font-weight: bolder;font-size: 30px">In the Field of ╥ </p>

			<p>Talking more about his mathematical contribution in arithmetic, the value of the number pi that he found out is about 0.66 percent higher than the true value of pi. He wrote that the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter (pi) could usually be taken to be 3, but if accuracy were needed, then the square root of 10 (approximately 3.162...).</p>

			<p>Some rules for calculations of positive and negative numbers were established by Brahmagupta. Here're some fundamental rules that we have been using for decades:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a negative number plus another negative number always result in a negative number.</li>
				<li>a positive number subtracts a negative number will have the same result when adding those two numbers.</li>
				<li>a negative number multiplies a negative number will have the same result when multiplying those numbers in positive forms.</li>
				<li>a positive number divides a negative number, or a negative number divides a positive number results in a negative one.</li>

		<div class="p7">	
			<p>Sage Bhaskaracharya is a renowned Mathematician and astronomer. He has written several books and proposed various ideas on several fields of maths and astronomy, which are even older than many other discoveries and inventions by those scientists of the western world. He has given proof for several theorems like Pythagoras. He gave new names to numbers, which can be counted quadrillion and even more. He has rendered several treatises for quadratic equations. His works on calculus are considered highly intellectual.</p>

			<p>Bhaskara was the first to introduce the concept of Infinity : If any finite number is divided by zero, the result is infinity.
			Also the fact that if any finite number is added to infinity then the sum is infinity. He developed a proof of the Pythogorean theorem by calculating the same area in two different ways & then cancelling out two terms to get a2 + b2 = c2.</p>
			
			<p>He is also known for his calculation of the time required (365.2588 days) by the Earth to orbit the Sun which differs from the modern day calculation of 365.2563 days, by just 3.5 minutes!</p>

			<p>The law of Gravitation had been proved by Bhaskara 500 years before it was rediscovered by Newton.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>His Bijaganita (“Algebra”) was a work in twelve chapters. It was the first text to recognize that a positive number has two square roots (a positive and negative square root).</li>
				<li>The Siddhanta Shiromani (written in 1150) demonstrates Bhaskara’s knowledge of trigonometry, including the sine table and relationships between different trigonometric functions. He also discovered spherical trigonometry, along with other interesting trigonometrical results.</li>
				<li>His work, the Siddhanta Shiromani, is an astronomical treatise and contains many theories not found in earlier works. Preliminary concepts of infinitesimal calculus and mathematical analysis, along with a number of results in trigonometry, differential calculus and integral calculus that are found in the work are of particular interest.</li>
				<li>Using an astronomical model developed by Brahmagupta in the 7th century, Bhaskara accurately defined many astronomical quantities, including, for example, the length of the sidereal year, the time that is required for the Earth to orbit the Sun, as 365.2588 days which is same as in Suryasiddhanta. The modern accepted measurement is 365.2563 days, a difference of just 3.5 minutes !His mathematical astronomy text Siddhanta Shiromani is written in two parts: the first part on mathematical astronomy and the second part on the sphere.</li>

		<div class="p8">
			<p>Dattaraya Ramchandra Kaprekar (1905-01-17 - 1986) was an Indian mathematician who discovered many interesting properties in number theory. He was born in the town Devlali, Maharashtra. Having never received any formal postgraduate training, for his entire career (1930-1962) he was a schoolteacher in the small town of Devlali in Maharashtra, India. Yet he became well known in recreational mathematics circles, and has a number, a constant, and a magic square named after him.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The Kaprekar constant, named after him, is a fascinating general property of all number bases and may demonstrate some important but unknown theorem in number theory.The Kaprekar constant, or 6174 (1949). He showed that 6174 is reached in the limit as one repeatedly subtracts the highest and lowest numbers that can be constructed from four digits (not all the same). This series converges to 6174 in fewer than seven iterations.</li>

				<li>The Kaprekar number (also called Kaprekar series, based on the Kaprekar operation). This is a number with the interesting property that if it is squared, then two equal parts of this square also add up to the original number. This operation, of taking the last n digits of a square, and adding it to the number formed by the first (n-1) or n digits, is the Kaprekar operation.</li>

				<li>He also discovered the Harshad numbers which he named harshad, meaning "giving joy" (Sanskrit harsha, joy +da taddhita pratyaya, causative); these have the property that they are divisible by the sum of their digits. Thus 12, which is divisible by 1 + 2 = 3, is a Harshad number.</li>

		<div class="p9">
			<p>Mahāvīra was a 9th-century Jain mathematician born in the present day city of Gulbarga, Karnataka, in southern India. He authored Gaṇitasārasan̄graha or the Compendium on the gist of Mathematics in 850 CE. He was patronised by the Rashtrakuta king Amoghavarsha. He separated astrology from mathematics. It is the earliest Indian text entirely devoted to mathematics. He expounded on the same subjects on which Aryabhata and Brahmagupta contended, but he expressed them more clearly. His work is a highly syncopated approach to algebra and the emphasis in much of his text is on developing the techniques necessary to solve algebraic problems. He is highly respected among Indian mathematicians, because of his establishment of terminology for concepts such as equilateral, and isosceles triangle; rhombus; circle and semicircle.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>He examined methods of squaring numbers which, although a special case of multiplying two numbers, can be computed using special methods. He also discussed integer solutions of first degree indeterminate equation by a method called kuttaka. The kuttaka (or the "pulveriser") method is based on the use of the Euclidean algorithm but the method of solution also resembles the continued fraction process of Euler given in 1764. The work kuttaka, which occurs in many of the treatises of Indian mathematicians of the classical period, has taken on the more general meaning of "algebra".</li>

				<li>Mahavira gave special rules for the use of permutations and combinations which was a topic of special interest in Jaina mathematics. He also described a process for calculating the volume of a sphere and one for calculating the cube root of a number. He looked at some geometrical results including right-angled triangles with rational sides</li>

				<li>Mahavira also attempts to solve certain mathematical problems which had not been studied by other Indian mathematicians. For example, he gave an approximate formula for the area and the perimeter of an ellipse.</li>

Choksi’s art projected the Bengali scientist in terms of “Mahalanobis distance”, a statistical measure frequently used in the studies of population distribution.</p>

			<p>Mahalanobis devised a measure of comparison between two data sets that is now known as the Mahalanobis distance. He introduced innovative techniques for conducting large-scale sample surveys and calculated acreages and crop yields by using the method of random sampling. He devised a statistical method called fractile graphical analysis, which could be used to compare the socioeconomic conditions of different groups of people. He also applied statistics to economic planning for flood control.</p>

			<p>The height of Mount Everest was not calculated by George Everest, but by a brilliant mathematician who has since been all but forgotten. Everest himself (who pronounced his name ‘ee-vrist’) had become the Surveyor-General of India in 1830, and by the next year was eagerly seeking a mathematician/topographer for his Great Trigonometric Survey of the area. A local college math teacher sent him the then-19-year-old Radhanath Sikdar.</p>

			<p> Sikdar was from Bengal and had become semi-notorious as a part of the Young Bengal movement of free-spirited noncomformists (expected to enter into an arranged marriage with a young girl, Sikdar had said no and walked away). However, he was also becoming known for his mathematical talents. Under Everest’s direction, Sikdar distinguished himself almost immediately with his level of technical skill and intellectual creativity. Sikdar would end up inventing a number of new forms of measurement, some of which far outlived him.</p>

			<p>Ganesh Prasad was an Indian mathematician who specialised in the theory of potentials, theory of functions of a real variable, Fourier series and the theory of surfaces. He was trained at the Universities of Cambridge and Göttingen and on return to India he helped develop the culture of mathematical research in India. The mathematical community of India considers Ganesh Prasad as the Father of Mathematical Research in India. He was also an educator taking special interest in the advancement of primary education in the rural areas of India.</p>

			<p>Prasad returned to India from Europe in 1904 and was appointed professor of mathematics at the Muir Central College, Allahabad. Within a year of his appointment at Allahabad, Prasad was sent to the Queen's College, Banaras and he continued there till 1914 when he was invited to head the mathematics department of Calcutta University. Ganesh Prasad was the Ras Behari Ghosh Chair of Applied Mathematics of Calcutta University (he was the first person to occupy this Chair) from 1914 to 1917 and Hardinge Professor of Mathematics in the same University from 1923 till his death on 9 March 1935. In between these two assignments he served Banaras Hindu University as professor of mathematics (1917–1923). </p>
