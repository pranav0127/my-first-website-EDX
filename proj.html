 	 			<p style="font-weight: bold;">Some medical treatments:</p> <p> Indians were the first to identify leprosy and many remedies for this disease were found in the Atharva Veda. The treatment of removing stones or the lithiasis treatment was first introduced in India. Historical studies have shown that in the 8th century, a well-known scholar Madhav mentioned about the symptoms and ways of immunization against small pox. We also have heard that the two ancient and alternative methods of treatment still popular, Ayurveda and Siddha, originated in India. They are still used for holistic healing. It was the ancient rishis and munis of India who mastered this method of treatment. Upendra Nath Bramhachari, a Nobel prize nominee and Indian medical practitioner, invented methods to treat visceral leishmaniasis or kala azar or black fever.</p>

 	 			<p style="font-weight: bold;">Radio/wireless communication:</p> <p> In 1909, Guglielmo Marconi received the Nobel Prize in Physics, for his efforts in the development of wireless telegraphy. 
 	 			But, not many know that it was Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose in 1895 who made the first public demonstration of radio communication waves, two years before Marconi’s demonstration in England. 
 	 			More than a century later, Sir Bose was posthumously credited for his achievement, which truly shaped the face of modern wireless communication.</p>

 	 		</div>

 	 		<div>
 	 			<p style="font-weight: bold;">Diamonds:</p> </p> Do you know that diamonds were first discovered in India? Huge deposits of diamonds were found in the midst of the alluvial deposits along the rivers Krishna and Godavari in central India. 
 	 			They were mined from there almost 5,000 years ago. Gradually, they were developed into precious stones as mentioned in various ancient India books. 
 	 			Till 18th century, India was the only country where diamonds were found and later on these sparkling stones were found in the mines of Brazil.</p>

 	 		</div>

 	 		<div>
 	 			<p style="font-weight: bold;">Steel and metal works: </p> <p>Indians were also the pioneers in metallurgy. Sounds strange, isn’t it? 
 	 			But as a matter of fact, high quality steel was produced in India almost 2,000 years back, much before it was used in the West. 
 	 			A seamless celestial globe was also invented for the first time in Kashmir, which is till today considered as one of the most remarkable achievements in metallurgy. Prior to this, it was considered impossible to make a globe made of metal without seams.</p>

 	 		</div>

 	 		<div>
 	 			<p style="font-weight: bold;">Systematic organized education system:</p> <p> How can we forget our ancient Taxila, Nalanda and other universities which introduced a systematic education system? Residential schooling or schools with hostels or in ancient terminology “Gurukul” also started in India, where a single teacher taught several students at a time.
				These are just a few of India’s inventions and discoveries which are accepted worldwide. Chess, snakes and ladders, basmati rice, yoga, Sanskrit, Ayurveda, water on the moon, plastic surgery, binary system, ink, Fibonacci numbers, fibre optics and many more, originated in India. As a matter of fact, the list is quite long to cover all ancient inventions and discoveries made in India…</p>
